								<font style="text-decoration: underline">SCRIPT for contacting CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS</font></br>
								Here’s a choice of phone call or email scripts to Oppose SB 50. (You may be asked for your zip code because senators want to hear from people in their districts).

							<ol>
								<li style="padding-bottom:20px;font-style:italic;line-height:1.5">
									“My name is ___. I live in your district. I’m calling about SB 50. As my representative, I urge you to oppose this bill. SB 50 will bring severe displacement and 
									gentrification and HURT the poor and working-class, and wipe out thousands of middle-class single-family-home neighborhoods. In our district, developers could decimate 
									areas like (fill in your area). SB 50 strips city zoning and planning powers in <font style="text-decoration: underline"> neighborhoods near bus or rail stops</font>, 
									letting developers go as high as 8 stories. The heart of this bill is demolition of housing. Our community will never recover.”
								</li>
								<li style="padding-bottom:20px;font-style:italic;line-height:1.5">
									“My name is ___. I live in your district. I’m calling about SB 50. As my representative, I urge you to oppose this bill. If SB 50 isn’t killed, my city (name) 
									<font style="text-decoration: underline">can only reject 6-to 8 story luxury towers in transit zones or “job rich” zones if the project “harms public safety." 
									Developers get to leave out parking entirely and wipe out green belts, side yards and setbacks where children play.</font> This means destruction of single-family 
									AND rental housing to make way for luxury one-bedrooms, forcing families further from jobs. Imagine the nightmare, and oppose SB 50.”
								</li>
								<li style="font-style:italic;line-height:1.5">
									“My name is ___. I live in your district. I’m calling about SB 50. As my representative, I urge you to oppose this bill. One-size-fits-all thinking doesn’t work. 
									SB 50 is a real estate bill, not a housing solution. Senator Wiener’s YIMBY base calls single family homes ‘racist’ and ‘immoral.’ Rather than solving the housing problem, 
									SB 50 promotes demotion, displacement, gentrification, and deepening income inequity.”

				Written by legislator Scott Wiener, SB 50 rewards developers to buy and demolish single-family housing and apartments near rail, train, ferry or busy bus stops AND near jobs and good schools. 
				SB 50 kills local planning rules, letting buildings tower over other buildings. The new homes can include NO parking, NO space for trees, NO setbacks, and NO design standards, unless your local city already requires it (most do). All that developers must do is 
				set aside a defined number of new units as affordable to those in poverty.

			<h2 style="text-align: center;"> FAQs </h2>

			<p style="font-weight:600;font-style:italic;margin:0 0 0.5em 0;color:#5292f9;font-size: 18px;">
				What is a jobs-rich/good schools area & why are they being up-zoned if they don't have transit?
			</p>
			<p>
				The definition of "jobs-rich/good schools" areas is undefined in SB 50, as of mid-March 2019. But according to the San Francisco Planning Department's new analysis, these zones may mimic "high resource" areas previously mapped by the State of
				California for other programs.
				</br></br>
				In our map, we roughly approximate the San Francisco Planning Department's approach in creating the yellow jobs-rich/good schools zones, within which buildings up to 75 feet high will be allowed next to, and replacing, single-family homes. Ours
				are purely projections and will be updated once the California legislature decides on a definition within the next month. Wiener has been quoted by some as saying he wants apartment towers in areas without good transit because single-family
				homes are "immoral" due to their massive ecological and carbon footprint, at a time when we must take drastic action to reduce transportation and housing emissions.

				What ELSE does SB 50 dramatically change in our communities?
			</p>
			<p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0">
				Developers can override up to 6 local zoning and planning standards,* in essence becoming their own zoners and planners. Thanks to quiet amendments made by legislators Wiener and Nancy Skinner to the obscure Housing Accountability Act of 1982,
				under SB 50, cities and counties can't fight a developer unless the project is <b>a direct, quantifiable public safety threat</b> (not an indirect threat, like smog, which is already covered by CEQA anyways).
				</br></br>
				In overriding local standards, developers can choose exemptions and waivers from a big menu including:
				<ol>
					<li>No parking required, to support car-free cities</li>
					<li>Override density maximums (number of apartment units per parcel) </li>
					<li>Slash or eliminate yards, and building setbacks for trees, instead opting for communal city parks funded through impact fees</li>
					<li>Allow demolition of historic buildings not protected by the state</li>
					<li>Eliminate on-site open space (balconies, courtyards)</li>
					<li>Ignore design guidelines</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p style="font-weight:600;font-style:italic;margin:0 0 0.5em 0;color:#5292f9;font-size: 18px;">
				Why does SB 50 say "minimum heights" would be 45 or 55 feet? It doesn't mention 75 or 85 feet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under state "Density Bonus" law, a developer can add up to 30 feet to the minimum allowed height. Under SB 50, which some call "density bonus on steroids," developers cannot build anything LOWER than 45 feet. Depending on how many affordable
				units a developer agrees to include, a developer can qualify for additional "bonus" stories, up to 30 feet above the minimum height of 45 or 55 feet.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p style="font-weight:600;font-style:italic;margin:0 0 0.5em 0;color:#5292f9;font-size: 18px;">
				What is a High-Frequency Bus Stop, and can transit agencies add bus stops that cause up-zoning?
			</p>
			<p>
				These are bus routes with extremely frequent service of 15 minutes during morning and evening hours and 30-minute service on weekends. Yes, transit agencies can add additional buses to meet the SB 50 criteria, setting off new rounds of future
				up-zoning in residential areas. We believe approval of the bill would set off battles against good bus service. In San Diego, several bus lines were recently increased to 15-minute frequencies, requiring just six months of effort, at modest
				cost. It is unlikely that residents of San Diego know that their communities would be up-zoned to apartment towers under SB 50, merely because they wanted better bus service.
			</p>
			<p>
				*The opaque wording of SB 50 says that developers can select up to 3 exemptions and waivers from planning and zoning standards. But the San Francisco Planning Department, California's most expert, said that on closer reading, they believe the 
				bill authorizes developers to claim up to 6 exemptions from planning and zoning standards.
